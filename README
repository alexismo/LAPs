This repository is an interactive experiment for an Interaction Design Master's thesis by Alexis Morin (alexismorin.com). The thesis bears the working title "Cultural Integration through Language Learning".
Using interactive word tiles, I aim to teach grammar in a visual and intuitive way to language learners.
